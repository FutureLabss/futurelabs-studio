For us, building Futurelabs.Agency was more than creating a pixel-perfect website, it was a journey to becoming, an evolution of talents, from learners and dreamers to world-class doers. A testimony of growth only possible in tech.

A few months ago, 10 core members of the FutureLabs community held a meeting to build a world-class agency website that will announce their intentions of dominating the global “Agency” niche to every visitor, all from the small-town of Ikot Ekpene.

After rigorous planning & research, they set off to design and build their dream agency website, the timeline was 3 months, a tidy 3 months of product design with Figma, building with React and a tiny bit of NodeJS, motion design with Adobe AfterEffects, designing models with Blender, and making art with several software and cobbling it all together with the artistry of a Product Manager.

A month turned to two and two months turned to three months. The product wasn’t ready and wasn’t looking like it would be ready soon. The challenges were multi-faceted, Some team members needed to upskill to deliver their tasks, some needed to be more committed to deliver the volumes of tasks required at tight deadlines, the deadlines were too close, and we built for launch instead of incremental updates and the most important mistake of all, being a small team trying to stay funcional, we lacked a project manager, which we deemed not so important and that turned out to be the costliest mistake (in terms of time) we made.

Somethings to keep in mind:

\- 6 months before we started building the studio site, half of the team had no career in tech, so we were basically building a world-class product with a rookie team, from the “backwaters” of Ikot Ekpene.

\- The Product Manager doubled as the Project Manager but how about when the product manager has tasks to deliver too, who keeps the team in line?

\- About 5 different tech niches were involved in building the site, a collaboration nightmare if mismanaged.

\- We didn’t have enough resources - interpret that how you may.

The first stage of issues was leveling up to be able to build the product, some people on the team learnt faster than others, after a while most leveled up quality wise but couldn’t keep up time wise. And some had to rotate between roles, some of the many lessons we leant were:

* Deadlines are important in measuring outcomes
* Modern software is built as components and shipping ahould be incremental amd agile
* Duration predictability is at best a guesswork except in areas of deep experience
* Product (project) evaluations should be agile and focused on the delivery of timely components, a week being the best tie to gauge output, in my opinion
* The project manager's role is continuously prodding and fostering cross-functional synergy and checking adherence to schedules on tasks that are predictable.

And lastly, while there are more openings for product managers than project managers in the tech industry, every product should treated as a project with several smaller components that make up the whole and the project manager should focus more on the components than the whole software.

We were only able to get our acts together and ship when we got a Project Manager onboard and going forward - at FutureLabs, we are treating all products equally as projects.
